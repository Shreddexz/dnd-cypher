# DnD Cipher

A simple tool that implements the caesar cipher with a custom font for encoding messages for DnD. The font is designed to be used with the [Thieve's Cant Cipher 3D printable tool](https://makerworld.com/en/models/554115).

## Use

The cipher translation tool is available on my website: [billyrebecchi.co.uk/dnd-cipher](http://billyrebecchi.co.uk/dnd-cipher)

## Setup

The script is written in TypeScript. Install typescript and run `.tsc` to transpile into JavaScript locally.
